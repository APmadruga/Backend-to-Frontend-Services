### SpringBoot API + SpringSecurity ###
#### Group: Andr√©  Madruga Paulo, Nikolay Novachuk, Dominique Tavares Ganime Bastos
*API to test the knowledge acquired during the bootcamp.*

Name of the project: **Backend-to-Frontend-Services**

In order to put api running you need to install docker https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ 

create and acount https://hub.docker.com/ 

if you're using intellij Ide install docker plugin

When oppening the project you need to run in project path in terminal 

``` docker-compose -f src\main\resources up mysql ```

Go back to project inicial path and run 

``` mvn clean ```

``` mvn package ```

``` docker build . -t projetofinal ```

``` docker login --username=dockerHubUserName --password=aaaaaaaaa ```

``` docker-compose -f src\main\resources up frontback ```


you can open Swagger connecting in port 8080 to test the api



This project aims to simulate a simple online shopping list for a user, where he aims to create his personal data using his personnal password and name, and edit it. Also, each created user is able to pick up different grocery products and create new invoce, knowing the total price of each invoice, consult his personal invoices, navigate the data added to database.
Before we started working, we defined our Swagger to FrontEnd to integrate the final result of our API.

This API consists of 4 models, of whom 3 are classes and 1 extenda a package of the SpringSecurity configuration:
* Models:
  * Classes
    * Invoice
    * Product
    * User
   * SecurityConfiguration:
    * UserDetails
    
To define a better method of storing, updating, and extracting the data stored from JAVA applications in the backend we use 3 repositories for our application purpose
* Repositories
  * InvoiceRepository
  * ProductRepository
  * UserRepository
  
With a specific functionality "service" we will check whether the given data is valid or not, using our Requests and Resposes, created for 3 main classes.
* Services
  * InvoiceService
  * ProductService
  * US
    * UserService - is used for a purpose of the SpringSecurity configuration
    
To invoke business logic update the model and returns the view that should be rendered we use controllers which are responsible for processing incoming requests.
* Controllers
  * InvoiceController
  * ProductController
  * UserController
  
 * Endpoints:
    * Post:
      * **NewProduct** - creates a product
      * **NewInvoice** - add products and associate an invoice to the user
    * Get:
      * **GetAllInvoices** - retrieves the invoices of a user
      * **GetInvoiceByName** - retrieves an invoce by it's name
      * **GetAllProducts** - retrieve all products
      * **FindInvoicesById** - retrieve a product by its id
    * Put:
      * **User** - modifies the User info
      
 * Exceptions
   * ResourceNotFound
     * Invoice Not Found
     * Add a valid name to invoice
